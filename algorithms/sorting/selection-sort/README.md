Selection sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input list into two parts: the sorted portion at the beginning and the unsorted portion at the end. The algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element, expanding the sorted portion by one element. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
