# DFS 

- DFS explores the graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- It uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of the vertices to visit.
- DFS does not guarantee finding the shortest path but explores all paths in the graph.
- It is commonly used to detect cycles, search for paths, or explore connected components in a graph.
- DFS can be implemented iteratively or recursively.
