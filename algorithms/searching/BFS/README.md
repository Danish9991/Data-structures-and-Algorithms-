# BFS
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to traverse or search through a graph in a breadth-first manner. It explores all vertices at the same level (or distance) before moving on to vertices at the next level. BFS guarantees that it visits all vertices at a given depth level before moving deeper into the graph.

- BFS explores the graph level by level, visiting all the vertices at the same depth before moving to the next depth level.
- It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to visit.
- BFS guarantees that it will find the shortest path (fewest number of edges) between the starting vertex and any other reachable vertex.
- It is commonly used to find the shortest path, shortest distance, or to explore all vertices in a graph.
- BFS can be implemented iteratively or recursively.
