# Insertion sort
Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by iteratively inserting an element from the unsorted portion into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array. The algorithm maintains a "sorted" portion at the beginning of the list, expanding it by one element with each iteration.
