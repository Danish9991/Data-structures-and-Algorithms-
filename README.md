******Data Structures******

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

******Linear and non-linear data structures******

Linear data structures are structures where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element is connected to its previous and next element. Examples of linear data structures include arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

Non-linear data structures are structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly. Elements can be connected to multiple other elements, forming a branching or hierarchical structure. Examples of non-linear data structures include trees, graphs, and heaps.
